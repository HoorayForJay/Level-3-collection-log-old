# Level 3 Collection Log v1.0
A plugin that hides the log slots that are unobtainable on a level 3.

Future versions plan to include:
* Accurate green colouring once all possible slots within a category have been logged
* Accurate maximum log slots for the total and each individual category
* Shift categories to fill in the blank spaces
