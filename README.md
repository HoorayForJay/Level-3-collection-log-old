# Level 3 Collection Log v1.0
A plugin that hides the log slots that are unobtainable on a level 3.

Future versions plan to include:
* Accurate green colouring once all possible slots within a category have been logged
* Shift categories to fill in the blank spaces
* Remove fire cape and jad pet as they require combat xp and are not indefinitely repeatable
* Accurate maximum log slots for the total and each individual category
* Skotizo /1
* All pets /33
* Champion's Challenge /9
* Slayer /57
* Miscellaneous /34
